# Affablebean React App

![Redux](/react/redux.png "Affablebean")

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Redux ToolKit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

## Installation

Install dependencies with `npm i` and run with `npm start`. You need to run the server first (see main README file) for the app to connect. Keep the default port as 3000, since it is hard-coded in the server. Once running, you can inspect the React app or Redux state with Chrome (or other) browser extensions. 

Run all unit tests with `npm test` and end to end tests with `npm run cypress:run`
