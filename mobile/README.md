# Affablebean React App

![Native](/mobile/native.jpg "Affablebean")

## Installation

Install dependencies with `npm i` and run with `npm start`. You need to run the server first (see main README file) for the app to connect. Change the **MY_HOST** constant in [utils.ts](src/helpers/utils.ts) to point to your server LAN IP Address - e.g. 192.168.1.12 - **NOT** `localhost` nor `127.0.0.1` will ever work. 

Run unit tests with `npm test`
