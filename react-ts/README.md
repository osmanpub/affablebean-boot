# Affablebean React App

![Redux](/react/redux.png "Affablebean")

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Redux Starter Kit](https://redux-starter-kit.js.org/).

## Installation 

Install dependencies with `yarn install` and run with `yarn start`. You need to run the server first (see main README file) for the app to connect. Keep the default port as 3000, since it is hard-coded in the server. Once running, you can inspect the React app or Redux state with Chrome (or other) browser extensions. The app has a Chrome launch debug configuration, so you can debug it in Vscode.

Run all unit tests with `yarn test`
