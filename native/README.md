# Affablebean React App

![Native](/native/native.jpg "Affablebean")

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.io/learn)

## Installation

Install dependencies with `yarn install` and run with `expo start`. You need to run the server first (see main README file) for the app to connect. Change the **MY_HOST** constant in `src/utils.js` to point to your LAN IP Address - e.g. 192.168.1.12 - **NOT** `locahost` nor `127.0.0.1` will ever work. Open the expo client on your phone and launch the Affablebean project!
