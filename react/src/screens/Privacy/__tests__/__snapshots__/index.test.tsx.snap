          What Personal Information About Customers Does AffableBean Co Gather?
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve your shopping experience at AffableBean Co. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer reviews and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store and platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the types of information we gather.

            Information You Give Us:
          </b>
           we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way.

           we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.

            E-mail Communications:

           to help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from AffableBean Co if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.

          Does AffableBean Co share the Information it receives?
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. AffableBean Co shares customer information only as described below and with AffableBean.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries which AffableBean.com, Inc., controls and that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>
            Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:
          </b>
            We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at AffableBean Co or sell offerings to you at AffableBean Co. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services or sell product lines jointly with or on behalf of these businesses.
           
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Third Party Service Providers:
          </b>
            We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Promotional Offers:
          </b>
            Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of AffableBean Co customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Business Transfers:
          </b>
            As we continue to develop our business, wemight sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that AffableBean.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Protection of AffableBean Co and Others:
          </b>
            We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of AffableBean Co, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice.

          How Secure Is Information About Me?
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.

        As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such AffableBean Co features as Your Profile, Wish Lists, and Customer Reviews. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the previous version for our records. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and Sale and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of AffableBean Co and orders placed with AffableBean Co, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)

      <p>
        If you have any concern about privacy at AffableBean Co, please e-mail us with a thorough description and we will try to resolve the issue for you. Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use and Sale will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
